This repository showcases my LaTeX typesetting work across multiple formats:
- Academic articles and reports
- CV
- Lecture slides and presentations
- Posters and infographics
- Books and educational material

## Highlights

- **Chemistry Textbook:** Russian-language educational material with glossary columns (Russian-English-Chinese).

Each subfolder contains both the source `.tex` files and the compiled `.pdf` documents.
